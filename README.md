About this project:

This is a small Excel project where I analyzed customer churn using a telecom dataset.
I started this project while learning Excel on DataCamp, and then continued working on it on my own to practice data analysis skills.
The goal was to understand how many customers leave the service and what factors might be related to churn.

Dataset:

The dataset is a telecom customer churn dataset.
Originally provided as part of a DataCamp learning project
It contains customer information such as:

Churn status
International plan
State
Other basic customer attributes

This dataset was used only for learning and practice purposes.

Tools used:

Microsoft Excel,
Pivot Tables,
Basic formulas and calculations,
Filters and sorting

What I did:

Cleaned and reviewed the dataset
Calculated:

Total number of customers
Number of churned customers
Overall churn rate

Used pivot tables to analyze churn by:

International plan
Customer segments
Created summary tables to clearly show the results

Key findings: 

A noticeable portion of customers have churned
Customers with an international plan show a higher churn rate compared to others
Some customer groups have higher churn than average

What I learned:

How to work with real-looking datasets in Excel
How to calculate and interpret churn rate
How to use pivot tables to answer business questions
How to structure a simple analysis from start to finish

Notes:
This project is part of my learning journey as a junior data analyst.
The dataset comes from a DataCamp project, but all analysis and summaries were done by me for practice and portfolio purposes. Also AI is used to format this summary.
